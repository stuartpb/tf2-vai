These are files used to make the main operations for touching up icons in Inkscape easier.

To install these files, it's recommended to put them in the respective folders in your user share for Inkscape:

On Windows: %APPDATA%/inkscape
On anything else: ~/.config/inkscape (newer versions) or ~/.inkscape (older versions)
